# EDHRec Web Scraper
I decided to brush up on some python by making a fun web scraping tool for MTG EDH Deck Creation. I typically spend HOURS ON END looking at EDHRec and typing every single card name for a particular commander I am looking at. After finally having enough, I decided to automate this a bit more!
