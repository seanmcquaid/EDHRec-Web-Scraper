#EDHRec Web Scraper
Decided to brush up on some python and try making a fun web scraping tool for MTG Deck Creation. I typically spend HOURS ON END looking at EDHRec and typing every single card name for a particular commander I am looking at. After finally having enough, I decide to automate this. 

To Do : 
1) Take in commander name / url from command line then perform search and return cards in a text file
2) Set up to return card names from nested CSS selectors
